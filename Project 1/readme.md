# **UNIX Shell Project**  

**Hello World! Welcome to our UNIX Shell Project!**  

This project was developed as part of **BRACU CSE321 (Operating Systems) Lab**.  

## **Group Members**  
We are grateful to have had an amazing team:  
- **Al Saihan Tajvi** (23301219)  
- **Farhan Zarif** (23301692)

## **Implemented Features**  

### **Al Saihan Tajvi**  
- Displaying a command prompt (e.g., `sh>`) and reading user input.  
- Parsing and executing system commands using `fork()` and `exec()`.  
- Supporting multiple in-line commands separated by semicolons (`;`).  
- Supporting sequential command execution using logical AND (`&&`).  

### **Farhan Zarif**  
- Implementing input (`<`) and output (`>`, `>>`) redirection using `dup()` and `dup2()`.  
- Enabling command piping (`|`) for any number of pipes.  

### **Sadik Mina Dweep**
