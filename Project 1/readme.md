# **UNIX Shell Project**  

**Hello World! Welcome to our UNIX Shell Project!**  

This project was developed as part of **BRACU CSE321 (Operating Systems) Lab**.  

- **Full Project Repository Link:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Al-Saihan/UNIX-Shell-CSE321)  

## **Group Members**  
I had the privilege of working with an amazing team:  
- **Al Saihan Tajvi** (Me)  
- **Farhan Zarif**  
- **Sadik Mina Dweep**  

## **My Contributions**  
I implemented the following key features in the UNIX Shell:  
- **Command Prompt Handling:**  
  - Displaying the shell prompt (e.g., `sh>`) and reading user input.  
- **Command Execution:**  
  - Parsing and executing system commands using `fork()` and `exec()`.  
- **Multi-Command Support:**  
  - Handling multiple in-line commands separated by semicolons (`;`).  
  - Supporting sequential execution using logical AND (`&&`).
